User Experience</h6><p>The frontend user interface is very intuitive and responsive. The use of a single webpage with upload page embedded into it means users will not get lost navigating between several different webpages trying to find the information they need. The position of the upload button is also large and clear, being visible to anyone that visits the website for the first time.</p><p>The backend user interface has a simpler look, having five separate upload buttons clearly labelled to tell users what type of file to upload, making it very indicative and easy to use.</p><p>The dashboard where explanations are presented is organised logically. Graphs are displayed with contrasting colours for visibility, and the layout has been organised to enhance the logical links between the graphs and their respective metadata. </p><h6>Functionality</h6><p>The functionality of the prototype product satisfied our primary goal: to be able to explain the most popular types of machine learning models and datasets. The explainer module is able to explain a wide range of models from medical to unemployment datasets, whereas the application itself can be opened and used on desktop and mobile devices across several operating systems.</p><h6>Stability &amp; Efficiency</h6><p>Stability and efficiency is the part where we feel improvements can be made if more time is allowed. Due to our budget constraint, the virtual machine that runs the backend Python code is not very robust, meaning very complex models and datasets above its capacity cannot be explained. The stability of the virtual machine can also be improved, as the time taken to explain the same model varies sometimes. However, our application still runs reliably on most of the common machine learning models and datasets. These weaknesses can all be easily dealt with by upgrading our virtual machine plan to a more stable and robust one.</p><h6>Compatibility</h6><p>The compatibility of our prototype application is good. As it is a web-based application, users can upload models and generate explanations from a wide range of devices across several operating systems. Our prototype application's compatibility with machine learning models is also good, as our application accepts standardised pickle (.pkl) files for model and dataset upload, along with h5 and other semi-standard file types. However, the applications does not accept non-standard or proprietary formats.</p><h6>Maintainability</h6><p>The maintainability of our prototype application is particularly good. The entire application is mostly based on Azure powered services, meaning that there is no need for complex cross-platform linking. </p><p>The virtual machine hosting backend explainer module and the database for storing data can all be maintained and upgraded easily through Azure's subscription plans, eliminating the need for manually upgrading and configuring them.</p><h6>Project Management</h6><p>Project management throughout the development cycles has been stable. Tasks are divided clearly and equally among each team member, and schedules for each person are organised logically.</p><p>Team members worked in parallel for the most part: Julian is responsible for developing the system backend and embedding it into the frontend, James is in charge training models for gathering information and handling project reports, Dylan has the task of constructing the application frontend and integrating it with the backend. When group work is required, the team would set up scheduled meetings and tackle the problem together.</p><h3>Future Work</h3><p>Below are some of the features we would like to implement if we were given more time to work on our prototype product:</p><ul><li>Better compatibility with non-standard model and dataset formats</li><li>A cleaner, better looking user interface for both the front and the backend</li><li>A feature to promote open-source and allow users to share their uploaded models</li><li>An upgrade to a more robust virtual machine capable of explaining complex models</li><li>A user system where users can register and login to save their model and explanation</li></ul></div></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="./testing.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Testing</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="./appendices.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Appendices </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
